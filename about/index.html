<p> I started doing photography in the year 2010. Sony NEX-3 was the first camera that I used to shoot. Since it was a mirrorless camera, I could quickly
  learn about the basics of photography. I do not remember shooting in Auto mode. Interest in astrophysics motivated me to play with settings to capture
  stars, moon and milkyway galaxy. I experimented with different settings which helped me learn light trail photography and other techniques. I used to 
  shoot a lot of pictures of nature, birds and animals which I have reduced now. My focus shifted towards Astro and Street photography.
  In 2017, my parents gifted me Sony a6000 which was a mirrorless camera. I got a vintage lens (1984) from Kiev in 2019 which was fully manual and adaptable
  to my a6000. With it I have shot the streets of Bengaluru (K.R Market, Lalbagh, Brigad road). Unfortunately, in 2021 my a6000 was damaged and it made me
  pause photography for a while. 
  In 2022, I bought a Sony a6100 and have resumed my photography. The motivation behind this website is to showcase my photography and improvise the same.
